Micro:
IC5A wrong feedback path
add follower for VOUT_SENS signal
change capacitors at active filter to 1206
wrong connections at body_OV_sensor IC2B change + and -


Macro:
add differential output
change current sensor to differential and connect low side of current sens resistors by wire(not to plane) to GND entry of board

New ideas:
change amplifier schematics: Q9 -> common base, add mirror instead of single Q12
add shield to current sensor (mechanical)
