# Clamp_MegaOhmMeter
This project is, as its name says, resistance measuring instrument (for high resistances) which utilizes CLAMP (same as current clamp) for measuring resistances of 
particular branch of circuit. Its application is usefull when you need to find leakages by measuring current through individual elements specifically when disassembly 
of construction is undesirable.
